        Dieter Rams is a German industrial designer and retired academic closely
        associated with the consumer products company Braun,
        the furniture company Vits≈ì, and the functionalist school of industrial design.
        His unobtrusive approach and belief in "Less, but better" design generated a timeless
        quality in his products and have influenced the design of many products, which also
        secured Rams worldwide recognition and appreciation.
