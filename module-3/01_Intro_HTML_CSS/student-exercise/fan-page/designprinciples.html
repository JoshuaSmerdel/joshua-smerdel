        <p><strong>1: Good design is innovative.</strong><br>The possibilities for innovation are not, by any means,
            exhausted.
            Technological development is always
            offering new opportunities for innovative design. But innovative design always develops in tandem with
            innovative technology, and can never be an end in itself.
        </p>
        <p><strong>2: Good design makes a product useful.</strong><br> A product is bought to be used. It has to
            satisfy certain criteria,
            not only functional, but also
            psychological and aesthetic. Good design emphasises the usefulness of a product whilst disregarding anything
            that could possibly detract from it.
        </p>

        <p><strong>3: Good design is aesthetic.</strong> <br>The aesthetic quality of a product is integral to its
            usefulness because
            products we use every day affect
            our person and our well-being. But only well-executed objects can be beautiful.
        </p>

        <p><strong>4: Good design makes a product understandable.</strong> <br>It clarifies the products structure.
            Better still, it can
            make the product talk. At best, it is
            self-explanatory.
        </p>

        <p><strong>5. Good design is unobtrusive.</strong> <br>Products fulfilling a purpose are like tools. They are
            neither decorative
            objects nor works of art. Their design should therefore be both neutral and restrained, to leave room for
            the users self-expression.
        </p>

        <p><strong>6: Good design is honest.</strong> <br>It does not make a product more innovative, powerful or
            valuable than it really
            is. It does not attempt to
            manipulate the consumer with promises that cannot be kept.
        </p>

        <p><strong>7: Good design is long-lasting.</strong> <br>It avoids being fashionable and therefore never appears
            antiquated. Unlike
            fashionable design, it lasts many
            years - even in todays throwaway society.
        </p>

        <p><strong>8: Good design is thorough down to the last detail. </strong><br>Nothing must be arbitrary or left
            to chance. Care and
            accuracy in the design process show respect towards
            the consumer.
        </p>

        <p><strong>9: Good design is environmentally friendly.</strong><br>Design makes an important contribution to
            the preservation of
            the environment. It conserves resources and
            minimises physical and visual pollution throughout the lifecycle of the product.
        </p>

        <p><strong>10: Good design is as little design as possible.</strong>v Less, but better - because it
            concentrates on the essential
            aspects, and the products are not burdened with
            non-essentials. Back to purity, back to simplicity.
